Note that when Plone is started in foreground mode, it is also automatically in development mode. Development mode gives better feedback, but is much slower, particularly on Windows."

msgid "Let's create our first users within Plone. So far we used the admin-user (admin:admin) configured in the buildout. This user is often called \"zope-root\" and is not managed in Plone but only in by Zope. Therefore the user's missing some features like email and fullname and  won't be able to use some of plone's features. But the user has all possible permissions. As with the root user of a server, it's a bad practice to make unnecessary use of zope-root. Use it to create Plone sites and their initial users, but not much else."

In either case, it may be undesirable for changes to be immediately visible."

A content item may be checked out, worked on, then checked back in. Or abandoned if the changes weren't acceptable. Not until check in is the content visible."
msgstr ""

#: ../features.rst:285
msgid "Plone's ``Workflow Policy Support`` package gives you the ability to set different workflows in different sections of a site. Typically, you use it to set a special workflow in a folder that will govern everything under that folder. Since it has effect in a \"place\" in a site, this mechanism is often called \"Placeful Workflow\"."
msgstr ""
