This user is often called \"zope root\" and is not managed in Plone but only by Zope. Therefore the user's missing some features like email and fullname and  won't be able to use some of plone's features. But the user has all possible permissions. As with the root user of a server, it's a bad practice to make unnecessary use of zope root. Use it to create Plone sites and their initial users, but not much else."

In that case, which initially applies to file and image uploads, the content object inherits the workflow of its container."

In either case, it may be undesirable for changes to be immediately visible."
msgstr ""

#: ../features.rst:305
msgid "Plone's working copy support solves this problem by adding a check-out/check-in function for content — available on the actions menu. A content item may be checked out, worked on, then checked back in. Or abandoned if the changes weren't acceptable. Not until check in is the content visible."
msgstr ""

#: ../features.rst:307

msgid "You may need to have different workflows in different parts of a site. For example, we created an intranet folder. Since this is intended for use by our conference organizers — but not the public — the simple workflow we wish to use for the rest of the site will not be desirable."
msgstr ""

#: ../features.rst:321
msgid "Plone's ``Workflow Policy Support`` package gives you the ability to set different workflows in different sections of a site. Typically, you use it to set a special workflow in a folder that will govern everything under that folder. Since it has effect in a \"place\" in a site, this mechanism is often called \"Placeful Workflow\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../features.rst:323
