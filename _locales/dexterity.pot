#: ../dexterity.rst:16
msgid "A content type is a variety of object that can store information and is editable by users. We have different content types to reflect the different kinds of information about which we need to collect and display information. Pages, folders, events, news items, files (binary) and images are all content types."

msgid "Remember the requirements for our project? We wanted to be able to solicit and edit conference talks. We could use the ``page`` content type for that purpose. But, there are bits of information we need to make sure we collect about a talk and we wouldn't be sure to get that information if we just asked potential presenters to create a page. Also, we'll want to be able to display talks featuring that special information, and we'll want to be able to show collections of talks. A custom content type will be ideal."
