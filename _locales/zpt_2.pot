msgid "The method ``toLocalizedTime`` is provided by the BrowserView ``Products.CMFPlone.browser.ploneview.Plone`` and runs the date-object through Plone's ``translation_service`` and returns the Date in the current locales format, thus transforming ``2013-02-17 19:21:15`` in ``17.02.2013``."

#: ../zpt_2.rst:102
msgid "The templates ``summary_view.pt`` and ``folder_summary_view.pt`` (which is the same but for folders, not collections) are very widely used and also widely customized, so you might as well get to know it a little."

msgid "Our addition renders the date of the respective objects that the template iterates over (thus ``item`` instead of ``context`` since ``context`` would be the collection aggregating the news items)."

msgid "In default Plone without ``plone.app.contenttypes`` this would be ``folder_summary_view.pt``, a skin-template for Archetypes that can be found in the folder ``Products/CMFPlone/skins/plone_content/``.

msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:126
msgid "We could check the html with firebug and look for a structure in the content-area that looks unique. We could also look for the css-class of he body"
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:132
msgid "The class ``template-summary_view`` tells us that the name of the view (but not necessarily the name of the template) is ``summary_view``. So we could search all ``*.zcml``-Files for ``name=\"summary_view\"`` or search all templates calls ``summary_view.pt`` and probably find the view and also the corresponding template. But only probably because it would not tell us if the template is already being overridden."
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:134
msgid "The safest method is using ``plone.app.debugtoolbar``.  We already have it in our buildout and only need to install it. It adds a \"Debug\"-Dropdown on top of the page. The Section \"Published\" shows the complete path to the template that is used to render the page you are seeing."
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:136
msgid "The debug-session to find the template is a little more complicated. Since we have ``Products.PDBDebugMode`` in our buildout we can call ``/pdb`` on our page."
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:138
msgid "The object that the url points to is by default ``self.context``. But the first problem is, that the url we're seeing is not the url of the collection where we want to modify since the collection is the default-page of the folder ``news``."

msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:166
msgid "There is a deprecated technology called 'skin-templates' that allows you to simply add some page-template (e.g. 'old_style_template.pt') to a certain folder in the ZMI or your egg) and you can access it in the browser by opening a url like http://localhost:8080/Plone/old_style_template and it will be rendered. But we don't use it and you too should not even though these skin-templates are still all over Plone."
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:168
msgid "Since we use ``plone.app.contenttypes`` we do not encounter many skin-templates when dealing with content any more. But more often than not you'll have to customize an old site that still uses skin-templates."
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:170
msgid "Skin templates and python-scripts in portal_skin are deprecated because:"
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt_2.rst:172
