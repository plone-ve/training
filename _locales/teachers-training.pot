msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:16
msgid "But if the training is part of building a new Plone site for a large organisation and part of the offer was end user training, the manager of the website presence is an important stake holder as well. You cannot depend on the students that they know what they want to learn, or even that they are motivated to learn anything."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:18
msgid "For marketing your training it's vital to describe learning goals. What will a student be able to do independently after following your training (tasks). The manager of a larger organisation will use this to select and value your training."

msgid "Probably you will do something in between to provide a good mix between theory, explaining, examples and exercises. But discuss this with the client (manager) who has asked for the training or if your students are allowed to decide this, ask it before or at the beginning of the training. When you are teaching a content editor that **has** to work with Plone next week, practice and stick to the basics. If you have a few webmaster that has some say in how the site will develop in the next years, show more features, options and tricks.

msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:58
msgid "With more than 4-5 people and more difficult subjects you'll probably have to shift to 'classroom' mode: set up a agenda, and stick to it. This is still doable with 1 trainer for 10-20 people, but when the level of individual students varies a lot and you also have and need to do exercises, you'll get stuck with only one trainer."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:64
msgid "Having two trainers is great for educating a second trainer, to monitor the room during a training, silently help students that have questions while the main trainer can continue discussing a subject. Unfortunately it's not always economically viable for smaller groups to have more than one trainer per group."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:69

msgid "You can identify beforehand if a student will be overqualified for the training and might not learn that much new skills during the training."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:84
msgid "It's vital to identify those students and move them to another training or let them skip it. Bored students are a jammer during a training, are in most cases unhappy about your training because they haven't learnt anything new, will start to ask 'advanced questions' that are out of scope and distract other students."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:90
msgid "And the reverse: verify that a student meets the minimum required skill for your training. If you don't want to teach HTML two hours before you can explain Zope Page Templates, that's a big win. If you have multiple of these students, discuss what to do with the client: adjust the training, plan a 'beginners' training before this training..."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:97

msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:110
msgid "Creating a (new) training will cost a lot of time and it's almost unfeasable to give trainings for a living or earn enough money with trainings if you have to rewrite every training every single time you have to give it. One of the big obstacles in finding and having more Plone trainers world wide is the availability of current and up to date material."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:112
msgid "The idea of sharing the Plone training material world wide is that you can focus on finding students and preparing and giving a training in a sustainable way and that we share the burden of keeping the training material up to date."

msgid "Depending on how you teach and which materials you have, it can be great to have two beamers and laptops: on one beamer you can present the agenda, schedule, excercices or training material. And the other laptop/beamer can be dedicated to showing hands-on demo's of editing content, developing, running, whatever."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:139
msgid "Why: It can be quite confusing for student to follow you if you command/alt-tab through windows every 3 seconds and the sentence they were just reading from the training material disappears from view again. It provides extra context."
msgstr ""

#: ../teachers-training/before.rst:144
msgid "Depending on the kind of training you give it can be wise to verify the capabilities of the laptops that students have to bring with them to the training if it is for example a developer oriented training."

So maybe you prefer to have a lot of theory first and then continue to the examples. If you then give a training to a small group of students and you notice they loose focus after half an hour or theory, it might be that they are more pragmatists and would love to see an example first before learning about the reasons why."

Also, you can observe your students during the training day and try to figure out on which kind of information they light up on or loose interest. Or even better: just ask them during a break.
