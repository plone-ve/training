#: ../theming.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Structural theming**: the construction of the HTML skeleton of a page "
"and getting the right content elements into the right spots. Also, "
"providing the CSS and Javascript elements to finish the presentation and "
"provide dynamic behaviors."

msgid "**Templating**, which itself has two aspects:"
msgstr ""

#: ../theming.rst:18
msgid ""
"Viewlet templates, which we might think of as the micro formatting of the"
" page. Remember when we looked at the viewlet map of a page? (Look again "
"via ``@@manage-viewlets``.) All those viewlets are provided via "
"individual, editable templates."
msgstr ""

#: ../theming.rst:20
msgid ""
"Content type view templates. Whenever we create a new content type or "
"modify an existing one, we'll typically want to create or modify a view "
"template."

"*Structural theming* is best accomplished via the Diazo theme engine. "
"Diazo provides a rule based mechanism for mapping content provided by "
"Plone into one or more master page designs."
msgstr ""

#: ../theming.rst:24
msgid ""
"*Templating* is accomplished by editing page template files which allow "
"us to mix object content from the ZODB with HTML. Plone uses its own "
"(actually Zope's) Template Attribute Language (TAL) for this purpose."

"If you're very good with Diazo, you can do very nearly everything with "
"Diazo rules. It's entirely possible to replace and reorder the tiniest "
"components of a viewlet with a clever application of a Diazo rule or a "
"little bit of XSL."
msgstr ""

#: ../theming.rst:60
msgid ""
"It's also entirely possible to do all your theming by customizing "
"template files. After all, your original Plone site is themed (with a "
"theme called Sunburst) even without turning on Diazo. Before Diazo joined"
" Plone (as an add-on in Plone 4.0), this is the way Plone was themed."

msgid "So, what's your strategy?"
msgstr ""

#: ../theming.rst:64

"For simple site themes that are structurally similar to out-of-the-box "
"Plone, just add CSS. Nothing more needed."

"For more complex themes or ones where you are provided with a theme HTML,"
" CSS and JS, use Diazo to move things around, to put the puzzle pieces "
"where they belong."

"If it's necessary to change a viewlet or the view of a content type, use "
"TAL templating."

"But, **do not** bother to learn how to work with Plone's viewlet "
