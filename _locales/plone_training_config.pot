msgid "Use the :command:`vagrant suspend` or :command:`vagrant halt` commands to put the VirtualBox to \"sleep\" or to \"power it off\" before attempting to start another Plone instance anywhere else on your machine, if it uses the same port.  That's because vagrant \"reserves\" port 8080, and even if you stopped Plone in vagrant, that port is still in use by the guest OS."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/instructions.rst:378
msgid "If you are done with a vagrant box, and want to delete it, always remember to run :command:`vagrant destroy` on it before actually deleting the directory containing it.  Otherwise you'll leave its \"ghost\" in the list of boxes managed by vagrant and possibly taking up disk space on your machine."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/instructions.rst:379
msgid "See :command:`vagrant help` for all available commands, including :command:`suspend`, :command:`halt`, :command:`destroy`, :command:`up`, :command:`ssh` and :command:`resume`."

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:6
msgid "These steps are automatically done by Vagrant and Puppet for you. They are only interesting if you want to know what goes on under the hood for preparing your virtual training environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:8
msgid "Vagrant is an automation tool for developers to script the configuration and starting/stopping of virtual machines using applications like VirtualBox or Vmware Fusion/Workstation. The beauty of Vagrant is that it is largely platform independent for Linux, Windows and Apple, so with one 'Vagrantfile' per project you describe a base installation virtual image and all kinds of virtual machine settings you would otherwise have to click and type together in Virtual machine application."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:10
msgid "What Vagrant for example does is install a port forward so that ``http://localhost:8080`` on your physical computer is automatically forwarded to the port Plone will be listening on in the guest virtual machine. After Vagrant has done its thing to set up your virtual machine we are not finished though. Although Vagrant has the option to prebuild specific images it would be a lot of work and waste of bandwidth to redownload a machine images (300-600Mb) each time we would like to change small things in our virtual training environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:12
msgid "Puppet is a configuration management tool (others you might have heard of are Chef, Ansible and SaltStack) and helps system admnistrators to automatically manage servers (real and virtual). We won't get into Puppet in detail, but it builds on top of our base Vagrant image to further set up our environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:14
msgid "Vagrant detects when you set up a new machine and runs Puppet or other Provisioners by default only once, although it also can be used to keep machines up to date, which is a bit harder. See the :file:`Vagrantfile` and `Vagrant Documentation <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs>`_, especially the *Provisioning* chapter."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:16
msgid "This is basically what Puppet does if we were to configure our system by hand:"
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:18
msgid "First we update Ubuntu and install some packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:41
msgid "Then we create a virtual python environment using virtualenv. This is always a good practice since that way we get a clean isolated copy of our system python, so that we do not break the system python by installing eggs that might collide with other eggs. Python is nowadays used a lot by your operating system as well for all kinds of system tools and scripting."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:47
msgid "Now we download and unpack a buildout-cache that holds all the python packages that make up Plone. This is an optimisation: We could skip this step and have buildout download all packages individually from the `python packaging index PyPi <https://pypi.org>`_ but that takes much longer on a first install."
msgstr ""

#: ../plone_training_config/what_vagrant_does.rst:54
msgid "Then we check out our tutorial buildout from https://github.com/collective/training_buildout and build it."
msgstr ""
