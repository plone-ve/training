  This chapter is about the React frontend Volto.

  Solve a simlar tasks in Plone Classic in chapter :doc:`frontpage`


.. sidebar:: Get the code! (:doc:`More info <code>`)

   .. warning::

       The code you modify is from the backend, i.e. ploneconf.site!

   Code for the beginning of this chapter::

       git checkout behaviors_1

   Code for the end of this chapter::

        git checkout frontpage


In this part you will:

* Use a listing block to show featured content
* Add own criteria for listing block

Topics covered:

* adding own collection criteria
* configuring listing block

Add Index as collection criteria
--------------------------------

To understand why we need a collection criteria for a dynamic frontpage in Volto and what a collection criteria is, we have to look at the listing block of Volto for a brief moment.

.. figure:: _static/volto_frontpage.png
   :alt: Listing Block sidebar

In the sidebar we see the `criteria` selection and if we click there, it'll show some of the choosable criterias ordered in categories like the following:

* `Metadata` contains indexes that are counting as metadata like Type (means Portal Types) and Review State
* `Text` contains indexes that are counting as text-data like Description and Searchable Text
* `Dates` contains indexes which are working with date-data like Effective Date and Creation Date

To get all talks we marked as `featured` we have to get the listing block to recognize our newly created index. This means we have to add our index to the collection criterias, so we can choose it.

To add our new index as a criteria so we can use it in a listing block or a collection, we have to switch to our `backend`. There we have to create a plone.app.registry record for our index. This can be achieved by adding a new file :file:`profiles/default/registry/querystring.xml`:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <registry xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
              i18n:domain="plone">

      <records interface="plone.app.querystring.interfaces.IQueryField"
               prefix="plone.app.querystring.field.featured">
          <value key="title" i18n:translate="">Featured</value>
          <value key="enabled">True</value>
          <value key="sortable">False</value>
          <value key="operations">
              <element>plone.app.querystring.operation.boolean.isTrue</element>
              <element>plone.app.querystring.operation.boolean.isFalse</element>
          </value>
         <value key="group" i18n:translate="">Metadata</value>
      </records>

    </registry>

To understand this code-snippet, we have to know the information and tags we are using:

* The title-value refers to the custom index, in our case the featured-index we just created
* the operations-value is used to filter the items for example `isTrue` and `isFalse` for a boolean field like ours
* the group-value defines under which group the entry shows up in the selection widget, what in our case should be metadata

.. note::

   For a full list of all existing QueryField declarations see https://github.com/plone/plone.app.querystring/blob/master/plone/app/querystring/profiles/default/registry.xml#L245

.. note::

   For a full list of all existing operations see https://github.com/plone/plone.app.querystring/blob/master/plone/app/querystring/profiles/default/registry.xml#L1

Like explained in the last chapter we can now restart the instance and import the newly added profile by using the `portal_setup` in our ZMI.


Add listing block to show featured content
------------------------------------------

Now we will go back to our frontend and open localhost:3000. To create a new listing_block on the front-page we have to click on edit first and create one new block. Now you have to choose the block `Listing` from the menu:

You will gain a new block and sidebar looking like this:
