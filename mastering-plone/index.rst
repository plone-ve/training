Mastering Plone 6 Development
=============================

`Mastering Plone Development` is intended as a training to learn proven practices of Plone development.

It's both, an online course and a sketch for an on the spot training.

The story of a conference platform provides a week-long training of several development topics that can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) that covers the essentials of Plone and Plone Volto.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) that covers advanced topics.

..  warning::

    This is the Mastering Plone 6 Training.

    The biggest change from `Mastering Plone 5 <https://training.plone.org/5/mastering-plone-5/>`_ is that Mastering Plone 6 teaches developing for the React-based frontend Volto as well as for Plone Classic i.e. using server-side rendered templates.
    In many chapters that use Volto there is a link to a chapter that covers the same tasks in Plone Classic, and vice versa.

    Plone 6 is not yet released and thus the training is a work in-progress and there are still some rough edges.
