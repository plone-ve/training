`Semantic UI` is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML. It provides a declarative API, shorthand props and many helpers that simplifies development.

Its React complement `Semantic UI React <https://react.semantic-ui.com/>`_ provides `React components` while Semantic UI provides `themes` as CSS stylesheets with less variables and rules.

Volto is per default, not mandatory, build on both: the Semantic UI theming and the Semantic UI React Components.

Volto applies `components` from `Semantic UI React` to compose a large part of the views. For example the component `List <https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/list/>`_ is used to render lists.

.. code-block:: jsx

    <List items={content.subjects} />

The above Semantic `List` component renders the list of subjects of the context content object. One example is the EventView.

Another example is the `container <https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/container/>`_ component, that wraps content to be rendered with a margin depending on the browser window size / media query.
You have seen this component already in the news item view.

See next chapter for theming with Semantic UI.
