Volto Basics
============

Volto is a React based frontend for Plone. Beside the **Plone Classic** frontend and other frontends it is the default frontend and editor from Plone 6 on.

The intention to build a new frontend was to achieve a new experience for editing the web.

Here are some things you should know if you are new to Plone 6 or Volto:

**Volto is the default frontend for Plone 6 but Plone can still serve as backend and frontend.**

* All data is stored in Plone, Volto comes in to display and edit the content.
* Volto is built in `ReactJS <https://reactjs.org>`_, a modern Javascript Framework.
* Volto uses `plone.restapi <https://plonerestapi.readthedocs.io/>`_ to communicate with Plone backend.

Details

* Volto is installed separately from Plone backend. See chapter :ref:`installation-Volto-label` for instructions.
* Volto runs in a different process than the Plone backend. By default Volto runs on port 3000. If you start Volto with ``yarn start`` you can see the frontend on http://localhost:3000. The Plone backend runs by default on http://localhost:8080
* To create a new Plone site in your already set up Zope environment you use the backend, this is by now not possible in Volto.
* Volto takes advantage of `Semantic UI React components <https://react.semantic-ui.com/>`_ to compose most of the views. For example the component `Image <https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/image/>`_ is used to render images.
* The Volto default theme is based on Semantic UI theme and is called `Pastanaga <https://youtu.be/wW9mTl1Tavc?t=133>`_
* Same as Plone, Volto is highly extendable with add-ons for further features.
* Existing Volto components are customizable with a technology similar to `z3c.jbot` called :ref:`volto_overrides-componentshadowing-label`.
* Volto provides server side rendering (SSR), important for SEO-purposes.
* Volto aims to provide 100% of the features of the current Plone backend. Not all features of Plone are implemented in Volto yet.
* Volto provides additional functionality that Plone does not have.
* For example Volto features the Pastanaga Editor, allowing you to visually compose a page using blocks. This feature is enabled for content types that have the dexterity behavior ``volto.blocks`` enabled.
* Using the Pastanaga Editor, the content you add in blocks and the arrangement of blocks is stored as JSON in the schema fields `blocks` and `blocks_layout` provided by the dexterity behavior `volto.blocks`. Additionally you can edit all fields of the content type schema in a sidebar.
* If you do not use the behavior ``volto.blocks`` the fields from a content-type schema are edited and stored exactly like previously in Plone.


**You have to decide for one frontend: Volto or the Plone Classic frontend.**

Here are some pointer that may help you decide:

* New projects should use Volto unless a important feature or add-on is still missing and cannot be implemented within the project budget
* Existing projects that are updated to Plone 6 can decide what frontend to use. If a lot of customizations were done and you don't want to reimplement lot of custom templates or features in Volto it is a good idea to use Plone Classic.


* Most existing add-ons for Plone will have to be adapted to Volto if they touch UI (e.g. templates for content types, control panels or viewlets).
