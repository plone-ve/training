=============================
How Does collective.solr Work
=============================

We used to depend on ``collective.indexing`` as a means to hook into the normal catalog machinery of Plone to detect content changes.
Now the support for alternative indexes is part of ``Products.CMFCore`` (since version 2.2.12).
However, to return results from solr via a catalog query a monkey patch is still required.

Base Functionality
==================

- Patches the ZCatalog
- Some queries are faster in Solr, some are not
- Indexes and Metadata are duplicated
- Full text search with SearchableText is handled by solr

Transactions
============

Solr is not transaction-aware and does not support any kind of rollback or undo.
We therefore only send data to Solr at the end of any successful request.
This is done via ``Products.CMFCore.indexing``, a transaction manager and an end request transaction hook.

This means you wonâ€™t see any changes done to content inside a request when doing Solr searches later on in the same request.

Querying Solr With collective.solr
==================================

ZCatalog Query::

    catalog(SearchableText='Foo', portal_type='Document')

Result is a Solr response object.

Direct Solr Queries::

    from collective.solr.dispatcher import solrSearchResults

    solr_search = solrSearchResults(
        SearchableText=SearchableText,
        spellcheck='true',
        use_solr='true',
    )

You can pass Solr query params directly to Solr and force a Solr response
with ::

  use_solr='true'


Mangler
=======

``collective.solr`` has a mangleQuery function that translates / mangles ZCatalog query parameters to replace Zope specifics with equivalent constructs for Solr.
